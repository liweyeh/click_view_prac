Hi

Steps to start:

-   In the root directory, run npm start to start the express server
-   In the client directory, run npm start to start the UI

Note:

-   I ran out of time (5.30 - 8.30, I could only spend 3 hours due to other peronal matter)
-   I would have installed nodemon and SCSS to oragnise the code better, but I gave up on that due to additional set up time
